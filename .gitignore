# assetWizardSettings.xml is sometimes ignored, sometimes not. If you share project, better to version it.
# Consider if .idea/assetWizardSettings.xml should be versioned or ignored.
# If a team shares code style, run configurations etc. then more .idea files might be versioned.
# For now, ignoring most of .idea/ is a common practice for individual or less strict team settings.
